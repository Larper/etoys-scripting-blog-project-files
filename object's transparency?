Dear Anthrop or vickiS,

I love your Etoys blog. I'm a tech ed teacher and I use Etoys for teaching programming basics.

Do you know how to change the an object's transparency? I want to make an object slowly appear by decreasing its transparency slowly with a script.

Please contact me at nevenmazic@gmail.com if you see this.
